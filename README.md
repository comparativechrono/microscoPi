Making automated imaging systems for circadian analysis is something I have been passionate for a while now. The motivation for this is simple - imaging solutions are often expensive, and cannot be deployed in situations of physiological relevance e.g. inside a growth cabinet.

Alex Webb introduced me to the wonderful world of Raspberry Pi's, and since then I have attempted to include Pi solutions wherever possible. 

This repo includes some of the code that we have used on various projects over the years. One of the take home messages from doing this kind of work has been to focus on the actual biological measurements, rather than an elegant solution. Often these imaging approaches have been taken with a need to gather data quickly - therefore simple unix or python solutions run off the command line are easier and more versatile than building a beautiful GUI.
